            <h3>
                Caesar Cipher
            </h3>
            <p>
                    Caesar Cipher is a simple type of encryption that uses substitution to shift the
                letters in a sentence to something else. Before the encryption begins a shift value is implemented to
                alter the sentence. This shift value works as the key. From there the sentence is broken up letter by letter and
                shifted down the alphabet the amount of times as the shift value. A shift value of 2 would make the letter A turn into C
                and a value of 3 would make the letter C turn into F. If the shift passes the letter Z the process just begins
                again from letter A.

                AES
            </h3>
            <p>
                AES is also known as Advanced Encryption Standard which uses a symmetric block cipher that takes a block of letters and
            and encrypts the message block by block. Each block size is 128 bits which is the largest that have been created yet.
            These blocks are encrypted using keys that are 128, 192 and 256 bits. Each block is given a different key and they are paired together.
            These encrypted blocks are then added together and put into one longer ciphertext. When it reaches its destination the blocks are decrypted
            one at a time and the user is left with the original message.

                Monoalphabetic Substitution
            </h3>
            <p>
                    Monoalphabetic Substitution is a cipher that takes each plaintext symbol in the alphabet
                and assigns it a cipher character. This correspondence works as the ciphers key. When you
                take the original message and exchange all of the characters with cipher characters you are
                left with a completely new cipher text that is unreadable. To reverse it, the receiver just needs
                to look at the correspondence chart and match the letters back to their original plaintext symbols.

                RSA
            </h3>
            <p>
                RSA which is known as Rivest Shamir Adleman (named after its creators) is a public key encryption method.
                It is used to exchange session keys in SSL/TLS protocols and it functions with integer numbers rather than
                bits and bytes. RSA uses complex math and formulas that are easy to compute in one direction but very
                difficult to compute going the other way. This creates a strong protection as the user can encrypt a message
                using RSA and unless the receiver has the key to how to solve the complex equation they will have no way of knowing
                what the message says.
